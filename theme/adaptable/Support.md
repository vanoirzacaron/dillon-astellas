As Adaptable is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) License it comes with NO support,
please see 'COPYING.txt'. If you would like support from me then I'm happy to provide it for a fee (please see my contact details
below).  Otherwise, the Moodle '[Themes](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46)' forum is an excellent place to ask questions.

If you think you've discovered a genuine bug with the theme then please look at the Moodle Themes forum first to see if it
has already been repoted.  Secondly, look at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jezhops/moodle-theme_adaptable/-/issues).  If nothing
is in either place then please read 'Reporting issues' below.

Free software
=============
Adaptable can be obtained for free from:

* [moodle.org/plugins/theme_adaptable](https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_adaptable).
* [gitlab.com/jezhops/moodle-theme_adaptable/-/releases](https://gitlab.com/jezhops/moodle-theme_adaptable/-/releases).

You have all the rights granted to you by the GPLv3 license.  If you are unsure about anything, then the
FAQ - [GPL FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) - is a good place to look.

If you reuse any of the code then I kindly ask that you make reference to the theme.

If you make improvements or bug fixes then I would appreciate if you would send them back to me by forking from
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jezhops/moodle-theme_adaptable) and doing a 'Pull Request' so that the rest of the Moodle community
benefits.

Required version of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle 3.8 version 2019111800.00 (Build: 20191118) and above within the 3.8 branch until the next release.

Please ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in '[Installing Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Installing_Moodle)'.

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated above - this is because the theme relies on core functionality
that is out of its control.

I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues in 'my' (not other developers of the theme) code for free.
Improvements are at my discretion.

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's
version.php file / or the top of the 'Information' settings tab.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version,
theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you
consider to be relevant.

You can use either the '[Themes forum](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46)' or '[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jezhops/moodle-theme_adaptable/-/issues)'.

Sponsorships
============
If you want to express your gratitude for using this theme, please consider sponsoring
by:

'buy me now' buttons under their terms.

Customisation

If you like this theme and would like me to customise it or transpose functionality from another theme then please contact
